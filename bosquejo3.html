              <p>Eleanor" is a customized 1971 Ford Mustang Sportsroof (redressed as 1973)
                that features in independent filmmaker H.B. "Toby" Halicki's 1974
                film Gone in 60 Seconds. The Eleanor name is also used in the 2000
                remake for a customized Shelby Mustang GT500.</p>
              <p>Though four Mustangs are portrayed in the
                film as "Eleanor" targets, only two cars were used for filming
                the movie, with license plates and tires alternated as
                necessary. Of these two, one car was modified for the stunt
                driving necessitated by the final chase and wrecked in said
                process, while the other was kept intact for all external "beauty shots."
                The latter car was also used for all but two interior shots.
